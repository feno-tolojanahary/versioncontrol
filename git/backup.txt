1. Incremental Backups:
Functionality: Instead of creating a full backup each time, only new or changed data since the last backup is uploaded to Wasabi S3. This reduces storage space and transfer times.
Benefit: Efficient use of storage and faster backup operations.
2. Backup Encryption:
Functionality: Automatically encrypt MongoDB backups before uploading them to Wasabi S3 using a strong encryption algorithm like AES-256.
Benefit: Ensures that backups are secure and protected from unauthorized access while in transit and at rest.
3. Backup Versioning:
Functionality: Store multiple versions of backups in Wasabi S3, allowing users to restore from any specific point in time.
Benefit: Provides flexibility in restoring databases to specific states or recovering from corruption or accidental data deletion.
4. Automated Backup Scheduling:
Functionality: Set up custom schedules for automated backups (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) without manual intervention.
Benefit: Ensures backups are taken regularly and consistently without requiring user input, reducing the risk of human error.
5. Backup Retention Policies:
Functionality: Define policies to automatically delete old backups after a certain retention period (e.g., delete backups older than 30 days).
Benefit: Helps manage storage costs by automatically cleaning up unnecessary backups, ensuring compliance with data retention regulations.
6. Backup Integrity Checks:
Functionality: Perform integrity checks on the backup data before uploading to Wasabi S3. This can include checking for corrupt data or verifying data consistency.
Benefit: Ensures that the backups are valid and not corrupted before being stored, reducing the risk of failed restorations.
7. Backup Compression:
Functionality: Automatically compress backups before storing them on Wasabi S3 to reduce the storage footprint.
Benefit: Saves on storage costs and accelerates the backup process by reducing the amount of data to be transferred.
8. Monitoring and Alerts:
Functionality: Implement monitoring and alerting for backup successes, failures, and performance issues, notifying admins through email, SMS, or integrated systems (like Slack or a monitoring platform).
Benefit: Provides real-time feedback on backup operations and quickly alerts teams to any issues, allowing for faster response and resolution.
9. Automated Restoration Tests:
Functionality: Periodically test backup restoration automatically to ensure backups are recoverable and in good condition.
Benefit: Increases confidence that backup data can be successfully restored when needed, reducing the risk of data loss during recovery.
10. Cross-Region Backup Replication:
Functionality: Automatically replicate backups from Wasabi S3 in one region to another Wasabi S3 region to ensure disaster recovery capabilities.
Benefit: Provides an added layer of protection by ensuring backup data is available in a different geographical region.
11. Granular MongoDB Backup:
Functionality: Allow users to back up specific MongoDB collections or databases, instead of entire clusters. This gives users more control over the data they wish to back up.
Benefit: More granular control over backup sizes and resource usage, enabling more efficient backups based on specific use cases.
12. Metadata Backup:
Functionality: Backup not only the data but also the metadata (indexes, users, and configurations) of the MongoDB instance to ensure a complete restore process.
Benefit: Makes the restoration process smoother, ensuring that MongoDB instances can be restored to their original state, including all configuration and indexing.
13. Backup Snapshot Support:
Functionality: Create snapshots of MongoDB volumes (e.g., EBS snapshots if running on AWS) and store them directly in Wasabi S3.
Benefit: Provides a fast backup and recovery solution without needing to dump data explicitly, useful for larger or high-throughput MongoDB deployments.
14. Compliance and Audit Logging:
Functionality: Keep detailed logs of all backup operations, including who triggered backups, the data that was backed up, and any failures or successes.
Benefit: Enables tracking for regulatory compliance and auditing purposes, ensuring transparency in backup operations.
